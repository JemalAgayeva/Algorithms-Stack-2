  add: 
    - new key gets hashed into a number
    - number is used as an idx in an arr
    - value is added to that idx

  find:
    - key is hashed into a number (same key will get hashed into same number)
    - hashed key used as the idx to retrieve the value

  - this is a way to not have to remember the idx of where a value is
  - to not have to loop to find the value
  - can just remember the key string and retrieve it directly
